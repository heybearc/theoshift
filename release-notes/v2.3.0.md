---

## 🎯 New Features

### Count Session Management
We've completely overhauled how you manage count sessions with powerful new tools:

- **✏️ Edit Sessions** - Update session name, time, and notes after creation
- **⏸️ Activate/Deactivate** - Control which sessions are visible to attendants
- **🗑️ Delete Counts** - Remove submitted counts to reset positions (no more submitting "0")
- **Better Validation** - Improved input handling when editing counts

### Event Dashboard Improvements
- **Accurate Fill Rate** - Now only counts active positions in fill rate calculation
- **100% Cap** - Fill rate never exceeds 100% even with over-assignment
- **Better Status Messages** - Clear indicators for event readiness

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Lanyard Management
- Fixed checkout error when assigning lanyards to attendants
- Removed non-existent `attendantId` field from API and frontend

### Count Session Issues
- Fixed deactivate toggle not updating session status
- Fixed edit modal checkbox not saving active state
- Fixed input validation allowing empty submissions
- Fixed modal closing when clearing numbers

### Dashboard Calculations
- Fixed fill rate showing 0% when positions were filled
- Fixed "Needs Attention - 100% Unfilled" appearing incorrectly
- Inactive positions no longer affect fill rate calculation

## 💡 How to Use New Features

### Managing Count Sessions

**Edit a Session:**
1. Go to Count Times page
2. Click "✏️ Edit" on any session
3. Update name, time, notes, or active status
4. Click "Save Changes"

**Activate/Deactivate:**
- Click "⏸️ Deactivate" to hide session from attendants
- Click "▶️ Activate" to make session visible again
- Use this to stage sessions before making them live

**Delete a Count:**
1. Go to "Enter Counts" for a session
2. Find a submitted count (green border)
3. Click "🗑️ Delete"
4. Confirm deletion
5. Position resets to blank state

### Understanding Fill Rate

The event dashboard now shows accurate fill rates:
- **Green (100%)** - All active positions filled
- **Yellow (75-99%)** - Nearly ready
- **Red (<75%)** - Needs attention

Only active positions count toward the fill rate, so deactivating positions won't affect your completion percentage.

## 🔧 Technical Details

- Enhanced count session API with `isActive` field support
- New DELETE endpoint for position counts
- Improved Zod validation schemas
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Optimized fill rate calculation logic

## 📊 Impact

- **Faster Count Management** - Edit and delete without workarounds
- **Better Control** - Stage sessions before going live
- **Accurate Metrics** - Fill rates reflect actual event readiness
- **Improved UX** - Clear feedback and validation
