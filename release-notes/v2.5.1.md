## 💡 What You Need to Know

### No Action Required
Everything updates automatically when you log in!

### About the Servers
The system uses two servers (Blue and Green) for reliability:
- When you log in, you connect to one of them
- The system automatically balances users between servers
- Both servers work the same way - you won't notice any difference

### Old Sessions
Sessions created before this update will show as "UNKNOWN" until you log out and log back in.
