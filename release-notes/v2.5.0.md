## ✨ New Features

### Session Management
Administrators can now see who's currently logged into the system!

**What you can do:**
- See everyone who's logged in right now
- Check if someone is actively using the system (🟢 Online) or just logged in but idle (⚪ Idle)
- See when someone last used the system ("Just now", "5 minutes ago", etc.)
- View login history and session details

**How to use it:**
1. Go to **Admin Portal**
2. Click **Session Management** (or the Active Sessions card on the dashboard)
3. You'll see a list of everyone who's logged in

**Why this helps:**
- Know who's working in the system right now
- Better security - see all active logins
- Helpful for troubleshooting ("Is Tom logged in?")

## 🔒 Security Improvements

### Event Access Fixed
We fixed an issue where some users could see events they shouldn't have access to.

**What changed:**
- **Before:** Everyone could see all events on the event selection page
- **After:** You only see events you have permission to access

**Who this affects:**
- **Admins:** No change - you still see everything
- **Overseers/Keymen:** You now only see events you've been given access to

**Example:** If Tom is an Overseer but hasn't been added to the "Circuit Assembly" event permissions, he won't see it in his event list anymore.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Event List Not Showing
Fixed a bug where Overseers and Keymen with valid permissions weren't seeing their assigned events.

**What was broken:**
- You had permission to an event
- But it didn't show up in your event list
- You had to be an Admin to see it

**Now fixed:**
- If you have permission to an event, you'll see it
- Works correctly for all permission levels

## 💡 What You Need to Know

### No Action Required
Everything updates automatically - you don't need to do anything!

### Sessions Explained
- **Online (🟢):** Used the system in the last 15 minutes
- **Idle (⚪):** Logged in but haven't used it in a while
- Sessions automatically expire after 30 days of not logging in

### Multiple Logins
You can be logged in on multiple devices at once (phone, computer, tablet). Each one shows as a separate session.
