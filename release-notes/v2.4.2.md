## ✨ New Features

- **Available Attendants Card** - Click the "Available Attendants" card on the Event Positions page to see a detailed list of attendants who are not currently assigned to any positions or serving in oversight roles. The card shows the count and provides a clean, numbered list with congregation information.

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Accurate Attendant Availability** - The system now correctly identifies which attendants are available by checking multiple sources: position assignments, oversight roles, forms of service, and user roles. Overseers and keymen are properly excluded from the available count.

- **Consistent Terminology** - Updated user-facing text to use "oversight roles" instead of "leadership roles" for consistency throughout the application.

- **Configuration Validation** - Added automatic validation to prevent configuration issues. The system now checks for common misconfigurations before every build, ensuring environment variables are properly managed.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Configuration Management** - Resolved authentication issues caused by environment variable conflicts between configuration files. The system now uses a single source of truth for all environment settings.

## 📝 Notes

- The Available Attendants feature helps you quickly identify which attendants can be assigned to positions
- Attendants serving as overseers or keymen are automatically excluded from the available pool
- Configuration validation runs automatically to prevent deployment issues
