Your account, events, and all data remain exactly the same - just the web address is changing.

- All your events, assignments, and settings are preserved
- Both domains work identically until February 1, 2026
- After February 1, 2026, you must use theoshift.com

## 🔮 Coming Soon

We're planning exciting new features for 2026:
