## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed event creation validation errors** - Resolved issues that prevented creating events when selecting department templates or parent events. The form now properly handles optional fields and accepts all valid department template selections.

- **Fixed department template dropdown** - Department template and parent event dropdowns now load correctly without errors, allowing you to link events to department templates for better organization.

- **Fixed "Volunteers Needed" label** - Corrected the form label from "Attendants Needed" to "Volunteers Needed" for consistency throughout the application.

- **Fixed parent event filtering** - The parent event dropdown now correctly filters out events that already have child events, preventing circular references in the event hierarchy.

- **Fixed department template usage count** - The department templates page now accurately shows how many events are using each template.

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Better error messages** - When form validation fails, you now see clear, specific error messages explaining what needs to be corrected.

- **Improved form handling** - The event creation form now properly handles empty optional fields, preventing unnecessary validation errors.

## 📝 Notes

- Event creation now fully supports the hierarchical event structure and department template linking
- All validation issues have been resolved for a smoother event creation experience
